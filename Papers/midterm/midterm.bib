In this paper, we build on work exploring the ability of canines to interact with touchscreen interfaces. We observe new requirements for training and explain best practices found in training techniques. Learning from previous work, we also begin to test new dog interaction techniques such as lift-off selection and sliding gestural motions. Our goal is to understand the affordances needed to make touchscreen interfaces usable for canines and help the future design of touchscreen interfaces for assistance dogs in the home.},

In domestic settings, touchscreens could provide a way for dogs to communicate critical information to humans. In this paper we explore how a dog might interact with a touchscreen interface. We observe dogs' touchscreen interactions and record difficulties against what is expected of humans' touchscreen interactions. We also solve hardware issues through screen adaptations and projection styles to make a touchscreen usable for a canine's nose touch interactions. We also compare our canine touch data to humans' touch data on the same system.

Our goal is to help enable SAR dog and handler teams to work together more effectively. Using a semi-structured interviews and guidance from K9-SAR experts as we iterate through designs, we develop a two-part system consisting of a wearable computer interface for working SAR dogs that communicates with their handler via a mobile application. Additionally, we discuss the system around a heuristic framework that includes dogs as active participants. Finally, we show the viability of our tool by evaluating it with feedback from three SAR experts.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s). Aged dogs suffer from reduced mobility and activity levels, which can affect their daily lives. It is quite typical for owners of older dogs to reduce all activities such as walking, playing and training, since their dog may appear to no longer need them. Previous studies have shown that ageing can be slowed by mental and physical stimulation, and thus stopping these activities might actually lead to faster ageing in dogs, which can result in a reduction in the quality of life of the animal, and may even decrease the strength of the dog-owner bond. In this paper, we describe in detail a touchscreen apparatus, software and training method that we have used to facilitate dog computer interaction (DCI). We propose that DCI has the potential to improve the welfare of older dogs in particular through cognitive enrichment. We provide hypotheses for future studies to examine the possible effects of touchscreen use on physiological, behavioural and cognitive measures of dogs' positive affect and well-being, and any impact on the dog-owner bond. In the future, collaborations between researchers in animal-computer interaction, dog trainers, and cognitive scientists are essential to develop the hardware and software necessary to realise the full potential of this training and enrichment tool.},

abstract = {In a questionnaire survey of dog owners, 88{\%} of respondents' dogs had received some form of training. Training methods varied; 16{\%} of owners said that they used only positive reinforcement, 12{\%} used a combination of positive reinforcement and negative reinforcement, 32{\%} used a combination of positive reinforcement and positive punishment, and the remaining 40{\%} used a combination of all categories. Seventy-two percent of owners used some form of positive punishment. The mean number of potentially undesirable behaviors reported was 11.3 per dog. Attendance at formal training classes did not significantly affect the total number of potentially undesirable behaviors reported. However, dogs that had attended puppy socialization classes were less likely to show an undesirable reaction to dogs from outside the household, and owners who carried out informal training at home, but did not attend any form of formal training class, were more likely to report some form of aggression in their dog. The training method used by owners was also related to the total number of potentially undesirable behaviors shown by the dogs. When individual categories of potentially undesirable behavior were investigated, the type of training method used was also significantly associated with attention-seeking score, fear (avoidance) score, and aggression score. Other factors related to the overall number of potentially undesirable behaviors included the age and origin of the dog.},

abstract = {One of the fundamental issues in the study of animal cognition concerns categorization. Although domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) are on the brink to become one of the model animals in animal psychology, their categorization abilities are unknown. This is probably largely due to the absence of an adequate method for testing dogs' ability to discriminate between large sets of pictures in the absence of human cueing. Here we present a computer-automated touch-screen testing procedure, which enabled us to test visual discrimination in dogs while social cueing was ruled out. Using a simultaneous discrimination procedure, we first trained dogs (N = 4) to differentiate between a set of dog pictures (N = 40) and an equally large set of landscape pictures. All subjects learned to discriminate between the two sets and showed successful transfer to novel pictures. Interestingly, presentation of pictures providing contradictive information (novel dog pictures mounted on familiar landscape pictures) did not disrupt performance, which suggests that the dogs made use of a category-based response rule with classification being coupled to category-relevant features (of the dog) rather than to item-specific features (of the background). We conclude that dogs are able to classify photographs of natural stimuli by means of a perceptual response rule using a newly established touch-screen procedure.},

abstract = {Excessive food intake and the resulting excess weight gain is a growing problem in human and canine populations. Dogs, due to their shared living environment with humans, may provide a beneficial model to study the causes and consequences of obesity. Here, we make use of two well-established research paradigms (two-way choice paradigm and cognitive bias test), previously applied with dogs, to investigate the role of obesity and obesity-prone breeds for food responsiveness. We found no evidence of breed differences in food responsiveness due to one breed being more prone to obesity than another. Breed differences found in this study, however, can be explained by working dog status, i.e. whether the dog works in cooperation with, or independently from, humans. Our results also confirm that overweight dogs, as opposed to normal weight dogs, tried to maximize food intake from the higher quality food and hesitated to do the task when the food reward was uncertain. These results are very similar to those expected from the parallel models that exist between certain personality traits and being overweight in humans, suggesting that dogs are indeed a promising model for experimentally investigating obesity in humans.},

abstract = {The emerging discipline of Animal‚ÄìComputer Interaction (ACI) aims to take what in Interaction Design is known as a user-centred approach to the design of technology intended for animals, placing them at the centre of the design process as stakeholders, users, and contributors. However, current regulatory frameworks for the involvement of animals in research are not animal-centred, regarding them as research instruments, unable to consent to procedures that may harm them, rather than consenting research participants and design contributors. Such frameworks aim to minimise the impacts of research procedures on the welfare of individual animals, but this minimisation is subordinated to specific scientific and societal interests, and to the integrity of the procedures required to serve those interests. From this standpoint, the universally advocated principles of replacement, reduction and refinement aim to address the ethical conflicts arising from the assumed inability of individual animals to consent to potentially harmful procedures, but such principles in fact reflect a lack of individual centrality. This paper makes the case for moving beyond existing regulations and guidelines towards an animal-centred framework that can better support the development of ACI as a discipline. Firstly, recognising animal welfare as a fundamental requirement for users and research participants alike, the paper articulates the implications of a welfare-centred ethics framework. Secondly, recognising consent as an essential requirement of participation, the paper also defines criteria for obtaining animals◊≥ mediated and contingent consent to engaging with research procedures. Further, the paper argues for the methodological necessity, as well as the ethical desirability, of such an animal-centred framework, examining the boundaries of its applicability as well as the benefits of its application. Finally, the paper puts forward a series of practical principles for conducting ACI research, which imply but also essentially exceed the welfare and ethics requirements of current regulatory frameworks.},

The results show that unit, integration, system and acceptance testing are the most frequent testing techniques used, but usability testing is not that common. Neither are alpha, beta, performance/load and security testing. Interviews were conducted to exemplify how practitioners conduct usability testing and what they describe as the difference between usability and acceptance testing. Some examples from the interviews show that practitioners are willing to do formal usability testing on extensive parts of the system, but because the iterations in Scrum are short and the changes to the system in each iteration are small, formal usability testing does not fit into the project work.},

Its evolution is technologically important because it allows the open-ended development of tools. New Caledonian crows manufacture an impressive range of stick and leaf tools. We previously reported that their toolkit included hooked implements made from leafy twigs, although their manufacture had never been closely observed. We describe the manufacture of 10 hooked-twig tools by an adult crow and its dependent juvenile. To make all 10 tools, the crows carried out a relatively invariant three-step sequence of complex manipulations that involved (i) the selection of raw material, (ii) trimming and (iii) a lengthy sculpting of the hook. Hooked-twig manufacture contrasts with the lack of sculpting in the making of wooden tools by other non-humans such as chimpanzees and woodpecker finches. This fine, three-stage crafting process removes another alleged difference between humans and other animals.},

abstract = {Design studies that use radiotelemetry require careful consideration of the goals of a project and the resources available to meet those goals. Success in meeting the research goals depends on thoughtful planning of field methods and ancillary data collection, selection of telemetry equipment appropriate to the study animal and budget, careful execution of the field protocols, and creative analysis of the data. Some of the most important design factors include consideration of the study's purpose; degree of experimental manipulation, controls, and replication; selection of an efficient yet unbiased sampling scheme; definition of the sample unit; calculation of sample size requirements; identification and removal of sources of bias; and clear specification of biological significance. This chapter emphasizes the need to integrate univariate metrics of animal choice, such as estimates of home range size and resource selection, with metrics for the demographic consequences of these choices, all of which can be generated from radiotelemetry. Radiotelemetry is an essential tool in modern studies of movement, migration, and dispersal of most vertebrates. Its use has dramatically increased the amount and detail of information available for estimating movements of larger animals, and provides extremely valuable additions to information from studies that use tagging, banding (ringing), and other forms of marking for smaller animals. In addition, radiotelemetry studies are an important complement to recent approaches that use genetic markers.},

abstract = {Working dogs are significantly beneficial to society; however, a substantial number of dogs are released from time consuming and expensive training programs because of unsuitability in behavior. Early prediction of successful service dog placement could save time, resources, and funding. Our research focus is to explore whether aspects of canine temperament can be detected from interactions with sensors, and to develop classifiers that correlate sensor data to predict the success (or failure) of assistance dogs in advanced training. In a 2-year longitudinal study, our team tested a cohort of dogs entering advanced training in the Canine Companions for Independence (CCI) Program with 2 instrumented dog toys: a silicone ball and a silicone tug sensor. We then create a logistic model tree classifier to predict service dog success using only 5 features derived from dog-toy interactions. During randomized 10-fold cross validation where 4 of the 40 dogs were kept in an independent test set for each fold, our classifier predicts the dogs' outcomes with 87.5{\%} average accuracy. We assess the reliability of our model by performing the testing routine 10 times over 1.5 years for a single suitable working dog, which predicts that the dog would pass each time. We calculate the resource benefit of identifying dogs who will fail early in their training, and the value for a cohort of 40 dogs using our toys and our methods for prediction is over {\$}70,000. With CCI's 6 training centers, annual savings could be upwards of {\$}5 million per year.},

abstract = {Working dogs perform a variety of essential services for their human partners, from assisting people with disabilities, to Search and Rescue, police, and military work. Recent interest in the nascent field of Animal‚ÄìComputer Interaction has prompted research in computer-mediated technology for communication between working dogs and their handlers. Haptic (touch) interfaces in the form of vibrating motors are a promising approach for handler-to-dog communication. Haptic interfaces can provide a silent, long-range method of sending commands to a dog, when voice or hand signals are inappropriate or impossible. However, evaluating haptic interfaces for dogs, who cannot self-report sensations, creates interesting challenges. This study draws on human‚Äìcomputer interaction concepts, such as Just Noticeable Difference, to explore methods and issues in evaluating haptic interfaces for working dogs. We created a haptic system and developed an evaluation method, reporting results for ten dogs of widely varying breeds, sizes, and coat types.},

abstract = {Driven by both applied and theoretical goals, scientific interest in canine cognition has experienced a rapid surge in popularity, especially over the last 15 years. Here we provide the most comprehensive review to date of dog cognition research, capturing all the articles (285) we could find on the subject going back to 1911. We begin by summarizing the general research trends, first documenting the rapid recent growth in dog cognition research (particularly in the domain of social cognition), and then identifying a number of trends in terms of the cognition topics and dog populations studied. Next, we summarize and synthesize the substantive conclusions emerging from research on nonsocial (discrimination learning, object permanence, object learning, categorization, object manipulation, quantitative understanding, spatial cognition, and memory) and social (responses to human cues, perspective taking, dog-human communication, and social learning) cognition. In light of the burgeoning research on individual differences in cognition and on the biological organization of cognitive domains, we highlight the potential impact of these topics on the dog cognition field. Finally, based on our syntheses, we outline some ideas for future research, including recommendations that studies focus on: (1) incorporating multiple sensory modalities (most notably olfaction); (2) using more diverse populations of subjects; (3) replicating studies where current knowledge is based on small study sets or on small samples; (4) identifying fundamental developmental patterns of cognitive development; (5) identifying individual differences in cognitive ability; and (6) identifying potential cognitive constraints (e.g. cognitive abilities that are nonindependent due to pleiotropic biological organization).},

abstract = {The ability to reason by exclusion (which is defined as the selection of the correct alternative by logically excluding other potential alternatives; Call in Anim Cogn 9:393-403 2006) is well established in humans. Several studies have found it to be present in some nonhuman species as well, whereas it seems to be somewhat limited or even absent in others. As inconsistent methodology might have contributed to the revealed inter-species differences, we examined reasoning by exclusion in pigeons (n = 6), dogs (n = 6), students (n = 6), and children (n = 8) under almost equal experimental conditions. After being trained in a computer-controlled two-choice procedure to discriminate between four positive (S+) and four negative (S-) photographs, the subjects were tested with displays consisting of one S- and one of four novel stimuli (S'). One pigeon, half of the dogs and almost all humans preferred S' over S-, thereby choosing either by novelty, or by avoiding S- without acquiring any knowledge about S', or by inferring positive class membership of S' by excluding S-. To decide among these strategies the subjects that showed a preference for S' were then tested with displays consisting of one of the S' and one of four novel stimuli (S''). Although the pigeon preferentially chose the S'' and by novelty, dogs and humans maintained their preference for S', thereby showing evidence of reasoning by exclusion. Taken together, the results of the present study suggest that none of the pigeons, but half of the dogs and almost all humans inferred positive class membership of S' by logically excluding S-.},
